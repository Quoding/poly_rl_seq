The algorithm needs to be model free:
    In practice, we can't control which states will and won't be available to try to access. Played actions lead to states which are then bound to the dataset via nearest neighbor search.

The algorithm needs to have a value function:
    We need the VF to have a regressor on the RR space to query offline. This means that a pure policy based method won't work in our application. Actor-critic or Value-based RL would work here.
